Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your proposal, it is well written. However, the topic is unfortunately not relevant for Zivid. We don't see how the proposed solution could be used in practice, in our field. In addition, we think there are serious challenges when it comes to acquiring sufficient amount of data required to go towards the direction you've proposed.

Have in mind that we are interested in neural network related research work and if you are willing to change the topic we could help and try to steer you towards something that would be beneficial for Zivid.

Please let me know if that would suit you so we can figure out how to proceed.


Kind regards,

Satja Sivčev

Hi Daniel,

I am terribly sorry for being this unresponsive. I should have told you that I will be since we got very busy.
Is it too late to work on a topic that would be useful for Zivid (using neural networks)?


Kind regards,

Satja Sivčev

Hi Satja,
I hope all is well.
I've got the code running on Ubuntu 18.04 - still sorting out
internship admin (slow communication and actioning at the moment due
to Covid) so no news on paperwork, yet.
If you are ok with me working on a proof-of-concept with your camera,
if you could hook one up with Ubuntu 18.04 box, point it to
transparent objects, and give me ssh with root access I could take it
from there?
All the best
Daniel

I am working on getting a loan unit for you. How does that sound?

Hi Daniel,

 

We shipped the camera to you last week, on UPS 1Z51220E0491978952

 

Have you received the camera?
