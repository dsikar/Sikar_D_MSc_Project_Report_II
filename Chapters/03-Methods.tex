%This chapter describes in detail the methods for whatever activities were necessary for your project â€“ e.g., data gathering, data analysis, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing/evaluation, etc. Your choice of methods should be discussed and justified in view of the project objectives, and with reference to the pertinent literature. Report not only what methods you applied in generic terms, but what you actually did: sufficient information about dates and details for your reader to understand how you ran your project, rather than just how one could run any similar project.

conda (\cite{Conda2021}) is a system that simplifies package management and deployment. It is part of the Anaconda Python distribution. conda allows environments to be created, saved and switched from one to another, such that separate environments can be configured and run. A list of conda commands used in this project is given in \ref{app:methods:conda}. While conda can act as a package installer, it is only used here as an environment manager, while pip is used a a package manager.
