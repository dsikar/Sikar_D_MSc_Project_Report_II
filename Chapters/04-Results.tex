%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%This chapter presents the outputs that you produced, by applying the methods that you have selected, including e.g. analysis, design, prototyping, experimental work, evaluation, etc.  
  
%How you report these results will depend on the nature of the work. It may be helpful to divide them into basic data (e.g., for a project that developed a software product, requirements specification, test data, etc.) and analysis of the data (e.g. statistical analyses, evaluation analyses, etc.). Remember that you are informing the reader of what you have produced and found and emphasising the interesting parts, 
% IMPORTANT - ADD SUMMARIES
% so summarising at the end of each major section is useful.  
  
%It is usually very helpful for the readers to include graphics and diagrams, for instance to clarify software design or requirements, identify key trends and relationships in empirical data, etc. If you do so, be sure to refer to these figures in the text and use them as evidence to support what you are explaining or arguing; and be sure that your figures are well designed and clearly presented â€“ do not just use default settings of the software you are using in producing them.  
  
%It is essential that you identify clearly what you accomplished or produced yourself, as opposed to what existed before you started your individual project or was provided by others. For instance, some projects build new software on top of an existing code base, add new data to an existing body of data, or are executed by a student as a member of a team. It is essential to indicate what parts of the activities and results which you report are your own work. If this is left unclear, the markers are instructed not to give credit for work that they cannot attribute to you. Ambiguity would attract penalties for poor academic practice, with delays caused by any investigation (deception would be treated as academic misconduct, of course, which may lead to expulsion).
