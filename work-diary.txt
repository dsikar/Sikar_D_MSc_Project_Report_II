Replicating experiment

2021.01.25

Replicated experiment ok on Ubuntu 19.04. TODO try 20.04 tomorrow.

Note, using a new conda environment might have something to do with this relatively
painless install, compared to first.

2021.01.25

Replicating experiment on Ubuntu 20.04.
Failing - missing libraries.

2021.01.28

Determining a number of Transparent Object Identification CNNs.

This is shaping up to be a "Comparison of Transparent Object Identification using RGB-D cameras and CNNs"

Looking into training a robot end-to-end to move objects.

Another angle, Unity has has a Robotic Hub on GitHub:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub

which integrates with ROS. One possibility is, using the simulator,
complete with robotic arm and sensor cameras, acquire the image, be in RGB
or RGBD, present it to processing pipeline and feedback to simulation
for object manipulation, and evaluate the pipelines that way. The expectation
being better pipelines will generate better path planning.
Note that the transparent objects are placed within unity.

Going through Zivid Academy:

Keywords: Structured light.

Error when running ZividStudio:

"An error occurred: Error occurred during initialization: An OpenCL error occurred: Failed to get platforms

Make sure the OpenCL driver is installed and working ('clinfo' needs to show at least one platform).

[CL_PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR]"

Recommended fix https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/428165/OpenCL+Driver+Check

For Ubuntu:

"Intel (Ubuntu)

Separately check OpenCL and OpenGL driver versions."

OpenCL Driver Check, ran:

sudo apt install -y clinfo
 
/usr/bin/clinfo

Output as expected:

(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:~/Documents/zivid$ /usr/bin/clinfo
Number of platforms                               0

OpenGL Driver Check, ran:

sudo apt install mesa-utils
 
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

Output:

(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:~/Downloads$ glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
OpenGL version string: 4.3 (Compatibility Profile) Mesa 20.0.8

Version 4.3, higher than 3.0 so presumed ok.

When running ZividStudio

cd /usr/bin
(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:/usr/bin$ sudo ./ZividStudio 
Segmentation fault

Restarted, ran ZividStudio from Ubuntu start, same error:

"An error occurred: Error occurred during initialization: An OpenCL error occurred: Failed to get platforms

Make sure the OpenCL driver is installed and working ('clinfo' needs to show at least one platform).

Reread Open CL Driver check:
https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/428165/OpenCL+Driver+Check

With note "In case the number of platforms is equal to 0 you need to install the OpenCL driver."

Current CPU:

"(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:/usr/bin$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 @ 3.50GHz"

Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650, which does not have integrated graphics according to:

While Zivid page states options for Ubuntu:

https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/428084/GPU+Requirements

Trying the python script:

(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:~/git/zivid$ pip install zivid --user
Collecting zivid
Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /home/simbox/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from zivid) (1.17.2)
Installing collected packages: zivid
Successfully installed zivid-2.1.0.2.2.0

Then suggested hello world to load library:

(base) simbox@simbox-wifi-server:~/git/zivid$ python hellozivid.py 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Options:

1. Get a workstation with Integrated CPU e.g. Intel i7 with HD630
2. Get graphics card e.g. Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 - ordered.

2021.02.28

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 card install.

Updated drivers by running:

# Check
$ ubuntu-drivers devices
# sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

Swapped NVIDIA gm206glm Quatro M2200 card for GeForce GTX 1060 then powered up.
To check devices:
