Replicating experiment

2021.01.25

Replicated experiment ok on Ubuntu 18.04. TODO try 20.04 tomorrow.

Note, using a new conda environment might have something to do with this relatively
painless install, compared to first.

Replicating experiment on Ubuntu 20.04.
Failing - missing libraries.

Determining a number of Transparent Object Identification CNNs.

This is shaping up to be a "Comparison of Transparent Object Identification using RGB-D cameras and CNNs"

Looking into training a robot end-to-end to move objects.

Another angle, Unity has has a Robotic Hub on GitHub:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub

which integrates with ROS. One possibility is, using the simulator,
complete with robotic arm and sensor cameras, acquire the image, be in RGB
or RGBD, present it to processing pipeline and feedback to simulation
for object manipulation, and evaluate the pipelines that way. The expectation
being better pipelines will generate better path planning.
Note that the transparent objects are placed within unity.

2021.03.14

Going over previous step from 2021.02.13

This time we have an NVIDIA GPU card installed, previous was an Intel GPU but for reasons not understood did not play with Zivid software.

Ideally we would have just swapped cards, but Ubuntu install was required to get NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 1060 6GB card working.

https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/59080712/Zivid+Software+Installation

1. Installing NVIDIA GPU drivers

https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/58294334/NVIDIA+GPU

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430

# checking number of platforms
$ sudo apt install -y clinfo
$ /usr/bin/clinfo
Number of platforms                               1
(...)

Above covers first section "Before installing Zivid Software". Next we go to section
"Select your OS and Zivid camera:" then to Zivid One and Ubuntu 18.04

$ wget -i https://www.zivid.com/hubfs/softwarefiles/releases/2.2.0+f0867d62-1/u16/ZividInstall1604.txt

$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb

Now zivid studio can be launched by searching "zivid" in Ubuntu launch. A firmware upgrade is
performed. An error message popped up about USB 3 being required to connect camera.
The Dell Precision T5810 does have one USB 3 port:
https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-uk/000125679/dell-precision-t5810-workstation-visual-guide-to-your-computer

Once connected to USB 3, Zivid Studio is able to make acquisitions and create point cloud, colour
and depth files.

Python scripting

https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/427542/Zivid+Python

pip install zivid failed with message:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skbuild'

We then tried installing from source:
$ git clone git@github.com:zivid/zivid-python.git
$ cd zivid-python/
$ pip install .

Got the same error message, then fixed with 
$ pip install scikit-build

Rerunning the install threw error:

!! Missing module 'cmake' !!
Please install 'cmake' manually or use PIP>=19

This could have been an oversight  from

https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/427556/Setting+up+Python

So maybe we forgot to install a C/C++ compiler:

$ sudo apt install clang --fix-missing
$ clang --version
(...)

Same error thrown. So we tried to install cmake:

$ sudo snap install cmake --classic

Same error message. So we upgraded pip installed
$ python -m pip install -U pip

then

$ pip install zivid
And that worked. So perhaps should have updated pip first (probably another oversight of mine when reading Zivid docs)

2021.03.15

Python scripting

Cloned Zivid python repo:

$ git clone git@github.com:zivid/zivid-python.git
$ cd zivid-python/samples
# capture a point cloud
$ python sample_capture.py
# capture rgb image
$ python sample_capture_2d.py

Photos with a glass cup using zivid studio show the camera is unable to capture a point
adequately as described by Sajjan et al. 2019.

2021.03.20

Installing cleargrasp (again), side by side with zivid tools.

1. From https://github.com/dsikar/cleargrasp, ran: 
1.1
$ . dependencies.sh

This failed to install libhdf5-10 libhdf5-cpp-11
which are Ubuntu 16 packages:
https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libhdf&searchon=names&suite=xenial&section=all
The corresponding 18.04 packages being  
https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libhdf&searchon=names&suite=bionic&section=all
so the edited line in dependencies.sh reads:
sudo apt-get install -y libhdf5-100 libhdf5-serial-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-cpp-100

We also needed the opengl package - see following notes.
$ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

1.2
$ pip install -r requirements_v2.txt

1.3 Downloaded data
$ wget http://clkgum.com/shreeyak/cleargrasp-checkpoints
$ unzip cleargrasp-checkpoints

1.4 Find 

$ find /usr -iname "*hdf5.h*"
/usr/include/opencv2/hdf/hdf5.hpp
/usr/include/opencv2/flann/hdf5.h

sudo apt install libopencv-dev python-opencv

When trying to "make", we got error:

../../pkgs/RNBasics/RNGrfx.h:42:21: fatal error: GL/glu.h: No such file or directory
 #           include <GL/glu.h>

After following some advice on:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/306703/compile-opengl-program-missing-gl-gl-h
(Todo, try the "apt-file search "gl.h"" method described.

And ran:
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

Then make was able to compile depth2depth.

Executable test, a minor edit (using "." instead of "bash"):
cd api/depth2depth/gaps
. depth2depth.sh
Executing with bash throws and error, 

eval_depth_completion.py
