Replicating experiment

2021.01.25

Replicated experiment ok on Ubuntu 19.04. TODO try 20.04 tomorrow.

Note, using a new conda environment might have something to do with this relatively
painless install, compared to first.

Replicating experiment on Ubuntu 20.04.
Failing - missing libraries.

Determining a number of Transparent Object Identification CNNs.

This is shaping up to be a "Comparison of Transparent Object Identification using RGB-D cameras and CNNs"

Looking into training a robot end-to-end to move objects.

Another angle, Unity has has a Robotic Hub on GitHub:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub

which integrates with ROS. One possibility is, using the simulator,
complete with robotic arm and sensor cameras, acquire the image, be in RGB
or RGBD, present it to processing pipeline and feedback to simulation
for object manipulation, and evaluate the pipelines that way. The expectation
being better pipelines will generate better path planning.
Note that the transparent objects are placed within unity.
